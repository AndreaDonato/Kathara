One router with two lans with two pcs. The assignment is: to configure the
topology to use SLAAC IPv6 addresses. The router is already configured to
advertise prefixes in both the lans.

You should check the sysctl ipv6 settings. Sysctl write can only be done
in the lab.conf OR in a priviledged container.

- All the pcs of the topology must have GUA addresses.

- pc1 has to use the default configuration for the Interface ID

- pc2 has to use a Random Interface ID

- pc3 has to use stable privacy extension, setting the stable_secret

- pc4 has to use the EUI-64 and use the temporary addresses. Set up
  a short lifetime in order to see multiple addresses. 

- router r1 is already set up. You only have to turn on the radvd server
  to capture the router advertisement packets using tcpdump.
  See the r1.startup and the /etc/radvd.conf file.

Remember to check the list of all the possible IPv6 settings in:
